         <div style="font-size: 50px; margin-top: 10px">M</div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;athura is the birthplace of Lord Krishna which is located at the centre of Braj called Shri Krishna Janma-Bhoomi.
       It is one of the seven cities (Sapta Puri) considered holy by Hindus.
       The Keshav Dev Temple was built in ancient times on the site of Krishna's birthplace.
       Mathura was the capital of the Surasena Kingdom, ruled by Kansa the maternal uncle of Krishna.
       Mathura has an ancient history and also homeland and birthplace of Krishna who was born in yadu dynasty.
        According to the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, 
        the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic.
        In the epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land.
        Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura.
        In the 6th century BCE Mathura became the capital of the Surasena mahajanapada.
        The city was later ruled by the Maurya empire and the Shunga dynasty.
        It may have come under the control of Indo-Greeks some time between 180 BCE and 100 BCE.
        The findings of ancient stone inscriptions in Maghera, a town 17 kilometres (11 miles) from Mathura, 
        provide historical artifacts giving more details on this era of Mathura.
        The Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions attest that Mathura fell under the control of the Sakas. 
        The inscriptions contain references to Kharaosta Kamuio and Aiyasi Kamuia. Yuvaraja Kharostes (Kshatrapa) was the son of Arta, as is attested by his own coins.
        Arta is stated to be brother of King Moga or Maues.
        Princess Aiyasi Kambojaka, also called Kambojika, was the chief queen of Shaka Mahakshatrapa Rajuvula.
        Kamboja presence in Mathura is also verified from some verses of the epic, the Mahabharata, which are believed to have been composed around this period.
        Mathura served as one of the Kushan Empire's two capitals from the first to the third centuries.     
        Mathura has an ancient history. According to the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic, the Ramayana. In the epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura.[citation needed]
        In the 6th century BCE Mathura became the capital of the Surasena mahajanapada.The city was later ruled by the Maurya empire (4th to 2nd centuries BCE) and the Shunga dynasty (2nd century BCE). It may have come under the control of Indo-Greeks some time between 180 BCE and 100 BCE. It then reverted to local rule before being conquered by the Indo-Scythians during the 1st century BCE.
        Mathuran art and culture reached its zenith under the Kushan dynasty which had Mathura as one of their capitals, the other being Purushapura (Peshawar). The dynasty had kings with the names of Kujula Kadphises, Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva I.[citation needed]
        Megasthenes, writing in the early 3rd century BCE, mentions Mathura as a great city under the name ?????? (Méthora).
        The Indo-Scythians (aka Sakas or Shakas) conquered the area of Mathura over Indian kings around 60 BCE.[citation needed]
        The findings of ancient stone inscriptions in Maghera, a town 17 kilometres (11 mi) from Mathura, provide historical artifacts giving more details on this era of Mathura. The opening of the 3 line text of these inscriptions are in Brahmi script and were translated as: "In the 116th year of the Greek kings..."[3][4]
        The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the "Northern Satraps", as opposed to the "Western Satraps" ruling in Gujarat and Malwa. After Rajuvula, several successors are known to have ruled as vassals to the Kushans, such as the "Great Satrap" Kharapallana and the "Satrap" Vanaspara, who are known from an inscription discovered in Sarnath, and dated to the 3rd year of Kanishka (c 130 CE), in which they were paying allegiance to the Kushans.[5]
        Mathura served as one of the Kushan Empire's two capitals from the first to the third centuries.[citation needed]
        Fa Xian mentions the city, as a centre of Buddhism about A.D. 400; while his successor Xuanzang, who visited the city in 634 CE, which he mentions as Mot'ulo, and said that it contained twenty Buddhist monasteries and five Brahmanical temples.[6] Later, he went east to Thanesar, Jalandhar in the eastern Punjab, before climbing up to visit predominantly Theravada monasteries in the Kulu valley and turning southward again to Bairat and then Mathura, on the Yamuna river.[7]
        The city was sacked and many of its temples destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018 and again by Sikandar Lodhi, who ruled the Sultanate of Delhi from 1489 to 1517.[8][9]
        Sikander Lodhi earned the epithet of 'But Shikan', the 'Destroyer of Hindu deities'. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, built the city's Jami Masjid (Friday mosque) .[citation needed] The noteworthy fact is that the exact place of birth of Lord Krishna, according to historians, is in the place of worship of the Hindus, though the mosque was built near the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The bigger Krishna shrine, better known as Dwarkadeesh temple is a few metres away from what is believed to be the actual birthplace of Krishna, was built in 1815 by Seth Gokuldas Parikh, Treasurer of Gwalior.[citation needed]
